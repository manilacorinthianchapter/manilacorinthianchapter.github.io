      <p class="lead">Welcome to the United Architects of the Philippines Manila Corinthian Chapter — where bold ideas, integrity, and passion for the built environment converge. As your Chapter President, I envision a year grounded in collaboration, resilience, and innovation. Our mission is not only to uphold the dignity and standards of our profession, but also to foster an inclusive and empowering community where every architect’s voice matters.</p>
      <p>We stand at a unique moment in time — a time when architecture must respond to global and local shifts in sustainability, equity, and digital transformation. Through our collective strength and programs, we will elevate discourse, create opportunities for learning and mentorship, and drive professional excellence across boundaries. I encourage every member to actively participate, connect, and shape the chapter you want to belong to. Let us lead with purpose, build with heart, and serve with pride.</p>
      <p>Together, we are stronger. Together, we are Corinthian.</p>

United Architects of the Philippines are we
Sworn to uphold our profession’s dignity
Ours is to create, to design and plan
Build the shelter for the Family of Man

As architects we build with artistry and vision
With humble hearts so patient & with dedication
Combining strength, utility and beauty
Be it a simple home or complex cities

Refrain:
One in heart and one in soul
All for one and one for all
These architects are the symbols of greatness
Loyal to the UAP

We pledge to ourselves to serve our country
With a fervent verve, so let us all be
Architects with a Filipino soul

(Musical Interlude)
With a fervent verve
So let us all be
The greatest strength of the U-A-P
