  Project: UAP Manila Corinthian Chapter Website
  Author: ArZ Miranda
  Date Created: 2025-07-19

  Version: 1.0.0

  Description:
    This script powers the interactive features of the UAP Manila Corinthian Chapter (MCC) website.
    It enables members to securely log in and view their personalized account information,
    including membership status, payment history, and contact details.
    The script also enhances the user experience by providing convenient tools such as password visibility toggling
    and easy options to save or print membership data.
    Data shown is dynamically updated from the MCC membership database to ensure accuracy and relevance.

  Usage:
    - This script expects specific DOM elements present on the page:
      - Login page: #loginForm, username and password inputs, toggle password button.
      - Account page: Elements with IDs such as #cardName, #statusBadge, #totalDue,
        payment tables (#paymentsTable), and toggle-sensitive buttons.
    - It relies on Bootstrap 5 for styling and interactivity,
      FontAwesome 6 for icons,
      and Supabase JS SDK v2 for backend database interactions.
    - User session data is stored in sessionStorage under 'userData' key.
    - Account info is auto-populated on page load if valid session data exists.

  Dependencies:
    - Supabase JavaScript SDK v2 (https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/installing)
    - Bootstrap 5 CSS & JS (https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - FontAwesome 6 Icons (https://fontawesome.com/)

  Change Log:
    2025-07-19 - v1.0.0 - Initial implementation with login, session handling, account rendering, and usability features.

  Notes:
    - Ensure that the <body> tag on the account page includes the 'account-info' class to trigger account initialization.
    - Sensitive member data such as PRC License, Email, and Contact Number are masked by default and toggleable for user convenience.
    - Payment data columns for different years are dynamically retrieved from Supabase for future-proofing.
    - Right-click and keyboard shortcut blocking have been disabled to improve user experience.
